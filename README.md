# Chennai Underwater

## Background
In 2015, annual monsoons brought record rainfall in the coastal regions of the southern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The rainfall triggered widespread flooding, inundating roads in major cities along the coastline. The city of Chennai was particularly devastated as the combination of poor structural regulation and illicit development weakened the city's flood preparednes [Times of India](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). With little data available, the open-source community sought to take matters into their own hands and crowdsource data to support first responders in the region (reference to come). 

## The App 
<bold>Chennai Underwater</bold> is proof-of-concept of a flood visualization platform. The app intends to aid first-responders in delivering relief to the most vulnerable communities (i.e. the most impoverished communities) in Chennai. Developed under the mentorship of Brent Porter (NASA) and the MAGIC Flood Response Team at TSGC NASA SEES 2017.
